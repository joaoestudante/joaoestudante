### JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o
Fan of interface design, human interaction with computers, and how to build software.

#### What I'm currently focused on:

- Developing a new tool for Splatoon players to manage their gear. Will be made public once it's more mature. Follow my journey at [joaoestudante.com](https://joaoestudante.com/blog/).
- Working at Autodesk Prodsmart, making factories more efficient.

#### Some projects I've worked on in the past:

- ðŸ‘€ Built [Radio Zero](https://www.radiozero.pt/)'s fancy uploading plataform, [RadiÃ³logo](https://github.com/joaoestudante/radiologo).
