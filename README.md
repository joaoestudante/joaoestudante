### João Lourenço
Fullstack Engineer. Fan of interface design, human interaction with computers, and how to build software. Currently at Autodesk Fusion Operations, helping make factories more efficient.

#### Some projects I've worked on:
- 🔥 Used `git-scraping` to store historical data about wildfires in Portugal. Built a dashboard live in [https://fires.joaoestudante.com](https://fires.joaoestudante.com), and the repo in [Github](https://github.com/joaoestudante/fogos-portugal)
- 🏭 Built a POC web app to visualize the savings in a factory provided by specialized sensors and units. Wrote about it in [my website](https://joaoestudante.com/projects/factory-savings)
- 🐙 Developed a tool for helping Splatoon 3 players manage their gear. Read about it also in [my website](https://joaoestudante.com/projects/splatoon-gear-db/)
- 🗣️ Made a web app to visualize voice actors which are common across different animes. Integrates with Anilist for easy comparison with your own anime lists. More in [this post](https://joaoestudante.com/projects/japanese-voice-actors/), live at [https://seiyu.onrender.com/](https://seiyu.onrender.com/) (be patient and wait for it to initialize 🙏)
- 🎤 Built [Radio Zero](https://www.radiozero.pt/)'s fancy uploading plataform, [Radiólogo](https://github.com/joaoestudante/radiologo).
- :pencil: Co-wrote two educational articles/resources:
  * [Temporal and Spatial Periodicity of Periodic Waves (Casa das Ciências, PT)](https://www.casadasciencias.org/recurso/7545)
  * [Secret Message with Binary Numbers (Casa das Ciências, PT)](https://www.casadasciencias.org/recurso/8935), [Teaching binary code with a secret word challenge (Science in School, EN)](https://www.scienceinschool.org/article/2021/teaching-binary-code-secret-word-challenge/)
- :rocket: Participated in the CanSat competition in 2017! The goal was to build a mini-satellite the size of a can. Our team reached the 3rd place in Portugal's finals.
- :speech_balloon: Helped translate the documentation of a [LaTeX Thesis Template](https://github.com/ekspek/ist-thesis) to English.

#### Outside of tech

I like to cook, photograph, play Padel and boardgames, and travel.
