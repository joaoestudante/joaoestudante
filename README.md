### JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o
Fan of interface design, human interaction with computers, and how to build software.

#### What I'm currently focused on:

- :wrench: Developing [ion-teaching](https://github.com/joaoestudante/ion-teaching) - an educational app/game to help students practice their ionic compounds skills.
- :clipboard: Writing my thesis. It's about using commits to migrate monolith systems to microservices! Check out the [thesis' repo](https://github.com/joaoestudante/thesis) for more information.

#### Some projects I've worked on in the past:
